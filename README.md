🧩 Mini Projects Collection
📘 Overview

Welcome to my Mini Projects Repository!
This repository is a collection of small projects I’ve built while learning and exploring different areas of programming, data science, AI, and web development.
Each project focuses on a specific concept, library, or problem — helping me strengthen my coding skills and showcase practical implementations.

🚀 What's Inside

Here’s a quick look at the types of projects included:

💻 Python Programming – basic logic, algorithms, and automation

🌐 Web Scraping – extracting and analyzing real-world data from websites

📊 Data Visualization – charts and analytics using Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

🤖 Machine Learning – simple prediction models and data-driven insights

🧠 AI Projects – intelligent systems for real-world use cases

🧾 Mini Utilities – command-line tools, calculators, and mini apps
